# 📚 Library Management System using Python

A complete Library Management System built in Python that supports both **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter.

This project helps manage a collection of books — including adding, removing, listing, issuing, and returning books — along with tracking issued records in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add books (manual entry or auto-generate sample books)  
✅ Remove books by ID  
✅ List all books with availability status  
✅ Issue books to students with issue date tracking  
✅ Return books and update availability  
✅ View list of all currently issued books  
✅ CLI and GUI versions available  
✅ Modular structure with reusable logic (`issue_return.py`)

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI interface
- **Standard Libraries** – `random`, `datetime`, `tkinter.messagebox`, `tkinter.simpledialog`
